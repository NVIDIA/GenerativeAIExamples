But in our problem, the flavors have a specific order condition: chocolate > vanilla > strawberry, so for each unordered partition, there's exactly one way to assign the counts to the flavors to satisfy c > v > s: the largest count to chocolate, middle to vanilla, smallest to strawberry. So yes, exactly the three triples we found: for {1,2,6}, largest=6 (chocolate), middle=2 (vanilla), smallest=1 (strawberry); for {1,3,5}, largest=5 (chocolate), middle=3 (vanilla), smallest=1 (strawberry); for {2,3,4}, largest=4 (chocolate), middle=3 (vanilla), smallest=2 (strawberry).
