Then counts (1,1,1), number of assignments: 3!=6, which is 3!/(1!1!1!)=6, correct. If we had 4 players, counts (2,1,1), number of assignments: 4!/(2!1!1!)=12, which is correct: choose 2 for first flavor, then 1 for second, 1 for third: C(4,2)*C(2,1)=6*2=12, yes.\n",

No, because \"greater than\" implies strict, so all counts must be distinct, which we have.\n",
