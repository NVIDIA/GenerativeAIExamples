tool_selector_prompt: |
 Your task is to answer questions. If you cannot answer the question, you can request use for a tool and break the question into specific sub questions. Fill with Nil where no action is required. You should only return a JSON containing the tool and the generated sub questions. Consider the contextual information and only ask for information that you do not already have. Do not return any other explanations or text. The output should be a simple JSON structure! You are given two tools:
 - Search
 - Math
 Search tool quickly finds and retrieves relevant answers from a given context, providing accurate and precise information to meet search needs.
 Math tool performs essential operations, including multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and greater than or less than comparisons, providing accurate results with ease. Utilize math tool when asked to find sum, difference of values.
 Do not pass sub questions to any tool if they already have an answer in the Contextual Information.
 If you have all the information needed to answer the question, mark the Tool_Request as Nil.
