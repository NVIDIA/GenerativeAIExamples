## Use Unstructured Documents as a Knowledge Base

1. Optional: If you configured your deployment with NVIDIA Riva, check **[X] Enable TTS output** to enable the web application to read aloud the answers to your queries.

   Select the desired ASR language (`English (en-US)` for this test), TTS language (`English (en-US)` for this test) and TTS voice from the dropdown menus below the checkboxes to use the voice-to-voice interaction capabilities.

1. On the **Converse** tab, enter "How many cores does the Grace superchip contain?" in the chat box and click **Submit**.

   Alternatively, click on the microphone button to the right of the text box and ask the question verbally.

   Click the **Knowledge Base** tab and then click **Add File**.

   Navigate to the `dataset.zip` file that is located in the `notebooks` directory. Unzip the archive and upload the PDFs.

1. Return to **Converse** tab and select **[X] Use knowledge base**.

1. Reenter the question: "How many cores does the Grace superchip contain?"

   ```{tip}
   The default prompts are optimized for Llama chat model.
   If you use a completion model, then you must fine tune the prompts.
   ```
