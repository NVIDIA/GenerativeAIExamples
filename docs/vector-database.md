# Configuring an Alternative Vector Database

## Supported Vector Databases

By default, the Docker Compose files for the examples deploy Milvus as the vector database.
Alternatively, you can deploy pgvector.

## Configuring pgvector as the Vector Database

1. Edit the Docker Compose file for the example, such as `deploy/compose/rag-app-text-chatbot.yaml`.

   Update the environment variables within the chain server service:

   ```yaml
   services:
     chain-server:
       container_name: chain-server
       environment:
         APP_VECTORSTORE_NAME: "pgvector"
         APP_VECTORSTORE_URL: "pgvector:5432"
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-password}
         POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-postgres}
         POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB:-api}
    ```

    The preceding example shows the default values for the database user, password, and database.
    To override the defaults, edit the values in the Docker Compose file, or set the values in the `compose.env` file.

    If you have existing setup remove `deploy/compose/volumes` directory to avoid pgvector crash.

1. Optional: If a container for a vector database is running, stop the container:

   ```console
   $ docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-vectordb.yaml down
   ```

1. Stop and then start the services:

   ```console
   $ docker compose --env-file deploy/compose/compose.env -f deploy/compose/<rag-example>.yaml down
   $ docker compose --env-file deploy/compose/compose.env -f deploy/compose/<rag-example>.yaml up -d --remove-orphans
   ```

1. Start the pgvector container:

   ```console
   $ docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-vectordb.yaml up -d pgvector
   ```

1. Optional: View the chain server logs to confirm the vector database.

   1. View the logs:

      ```console
      $ docker logs -f chain-server
      ```

   1. Upload a document to the knowledge base.
      Refer to [](./using-sample-web-application.md#use-unstructured-documents-as-a-knowledge-base) for more information.

   1. Confirm the log output includes the vector database:

      ```output
      INFO:RetrievalAugmentedGeneration.common.utils:Using pgvector as vector store
      INFO:RetrievalAugmentedGeneration.common.utils:Using PGVector collection: <example-name>
      ```

   ```

1. Start the Milvus container:

   ```console
   $ docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-vectordb.yaml up -d milvus
   ```
