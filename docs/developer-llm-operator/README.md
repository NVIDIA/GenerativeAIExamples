# NVIDIA Developer LLM Operator

The NVIDIA Developer LLM Operator enables developers to
build RAG-LLM pipelines on Kubernetes and manage the lifecycle of the
components for a sample pipeline.

The Operator manages the lifecycle of the following components:

- **Jupyter Notebook server**:
  The container includes sample notebooks to demonstrate a sample pipeline.

- **Chatbot web application**:
  The sample web application enables you to perform question and answering with the chatbot
  and to upload PDF documents to form a knowledge base.

- **Vector database**:
  The sample pipeline uses Milvus to manage the embeddings generated by the LLM.

- **NVIDIA Triton Inference Server**:
  The server is configured with the NVIDIA Nemo Framework for working with LLMs.

Refer to [Installing the Operator](./install.md) to get started.
