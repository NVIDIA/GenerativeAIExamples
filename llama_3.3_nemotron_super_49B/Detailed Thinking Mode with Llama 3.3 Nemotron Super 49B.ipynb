    "\n",
    "For the first example, we'll look at the model with detailed thinking \"on\". With the system prompt set to enable detailed thinking, the model will behave as a long-thinking reasoning model and is most effective for complex reasoning tasks. Before outputting a final response, the model will generate a number of tokens enclosed by \"thinking\" tags. "

      "Okay, so I need to solve the equation x*(sin(x) + 2) = 0. Hmm, let me think. I remember from algebra that if a product of two things is zero, then at least one of them has to be zero. That's the zero product property. So, in this case, either x = 0 or sin(x) + 2 = 0. Let me write that down:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. x = 0\n",
      "2. sin(x) + 2 = 0\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, starting with the first one, x = 0. That seems straightforward. If x is 0, then plugging back into the original equation: 0*(sin(0) + 2) = 0*(0 + 2) = 0*2 = 0. Yep, that works. So x = 0 is definitely a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the second part: sin(x) + 2 = 0. Let me solve for sin(x). Subtract 2 from both sides: sin(x) = -2. Wait a minute, sin(x) equals -2? But the sine function has a range of [-1, 1]. That means sin(x) can never be less than -1 or greater than 1. So sin(x) = -2 is impossible. Therefore, there are no solutions from the second equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the only solution is x = 0. Let me double-check. If x is 0, then the equation holds true. If x is any other number, sin(x) + 2 would be at least -1 + 2 = 1, so the product x*(something at least 1) would only be zero if x is zero. Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what if x is a complex number? The problem didn't specify, but usually when solving equations like this without context, we assume real numbers. So I think it's safe to stick with real solutions here. In the complex plane, sine can take on values outside [-1, 1], but solving sin(x) = -2 in complex analysis is more complicated and probably beyond the scope of this problem. The question seems to be expecting real solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the only real solution is x = 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Answer**\n",
      "The solution is \\boxed{0}.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve the equation \\( x(\\sin(x) + 2) = 0 \\), we use the zero product property, which states that if a product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. This gives us two cases to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \\( x = 0 \\)\n",
      "2. \\( \\sin(x) + 2 = 0 \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first case, \\( x = 0 \\):\n",
      "- Substituting \\( x = 0 \\) into the original equation, we get \\( 0(\\sin(0) + 2) = 0 \\), which is true. Therefore, \\( x = 0 \\) is a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the second case, \\( \\sin(x) + 2 = 0 \\):\n",
      "- Solving for \\( \\sin(x) \\), we get \\( \\sin(x) = -2 \\). However, the sine function has a range of \\([-1, 1]\\), so \\( \\sin(x) = -2 \\) is impossible. Therefore, there are no solutions from this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the second case yields no solutions, the only solution is \\( x = 0 \\).\n",
