      Input Document:
      After the outbreak of World War I the Defence of the Realm Act was passed by Parliament in 1914. One section of the Act concerned the hours pubs could sell alcohol, as it was believed that alcohol consumption would interfere with the war effort. It restricted opening hours for licensed premises to luncheon (12: 00 to 14: 40) and supper (18: 30 to 21: 30). In the late 1980s the licensing laws in England and Wales became less restricted and allowed pubs to allow the consumption of alcohol on the premises from 11: 00 until 23: 00, although nightclubs were allowed to stay open much later. Significantly revised rules were introduced in November 2005, when hour limits were scrapped, and pubs were allowed to apply for licences as permissive as "24 hours a day \'\'. In practice, most pubs chose to apply for more restrictive licences.

      Question:
      when did all day drinking start in england?

      You are an evaluator who is rating questions to given context passages based on the given criteria. Assess the given question for clarity and answerability given enough domain knowledge, consider the following evaluation criterion:
      Criterion 1 - Can the question be understood and answered without needing additional context or access to external references not provided within the question itself? Questions should be self-contained, meaning they do not rely on specific documents, tables, or prior knowledge not shared within the question.
      Criterion 2 - Is it clear what type of answer or information the question seeks? The question should convey its purpose without ambiguity, allowing for a direct and relevant response.
      Criterion 3 - Does the content in the context contain information that can answer the question or part of the question?
      Criterion 4 - Does the content in the context completely answer the question?
      
      Provide your response in a mandatory dictionary format, and a short explanation of the rating like
      {
      \"criterion_1_explanation\": "<Brief explanation of why criterion_1 was satisfied or not satisfied>",
      \"criterion_1\": "<Y/N>",
      \"criterion_2_explanation\":  "<State the purpose of the question and justify why it was satisfied or not satisfied>",
      \"criterion_2\": "<Y/N>",
      \"criterion_3_explanation\": "<Show what parts of the content contain relevant information to the question if this criterion is satisfied, state why the information is irrelevant if unsatisfied>",
      \"criterion_3\": "<Y/N>",
      \"criterion_4_explanation\": "<Extract spans from the content that help completely answer the question if criterion is satisfied, state what parts are missing if not satisfied>",
      \"criterion_4\": "<Y/N>"
      }
      Provide only the dictionary response and nothing else.
