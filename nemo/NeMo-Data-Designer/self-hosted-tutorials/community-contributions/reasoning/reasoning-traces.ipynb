    "- This notebook demonstrates how to use NeMo Data Designer to build a synthetic data generation pipeline tailored for reasoning tasks.\n",

    "  fine-tuning language models with reinforcement learning techniques and invoking chain-of-thought processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These synthetic reasoning traces can be used to enhance model performance in areas such as mathematics, coding, scientific \\\n",
