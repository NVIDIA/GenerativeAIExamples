    "\n",
    "- NeMo Data Designer includes a built-in code validation feature that automatically checks the syntactic correctness and executable validity of \\\n",
    "  generated code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This helps ensure that outputs from language models are not only syntactically correct, but also able to run successfully in the \\\n",
    "  intended programming language environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leveraging this validation step significantly increases dataset quality by promptly identifying invalid or non-functional code, \\\n",
    "  streamlining the process of generating reliable and production-ready data samples.\n",
