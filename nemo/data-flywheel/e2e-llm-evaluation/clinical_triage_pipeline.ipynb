        "**Problem:** Accurately labeling Emergency Severity Index (ESI) levels from nurse triage notes is crucial for clinical research and model development. However, real-world data is highly sensitive and access is often limited. Obtaining high-quality human annotations is also costly and slow, which makes it challenging to create large, diverse datasets for robust evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:** Synthetic data provides a scalable and privacy-preserving approach. By simulating realistic triage notes and ESI labels, we can build rich datasets without exposing patient information or relying heavily on human annotators. This strategy accelerates iteration, benchmarking, and model improvement, addressing key bottlenecks caused by data scarcity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use case:** Predict ESI levels from synthetic nurse triage notes using LLMs\n",
        "- **Goal:** Evaluate model accuracy and the quality/complexity of generated notes across a range of clinical scenarios\n",
