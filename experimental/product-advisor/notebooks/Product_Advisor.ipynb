    "Generative AI & LLMs enable Retailers to build novel and innovative solutions that empower internal employees, reduce costs, and revolutionize the customer experience. As the world’s most advanced platform for accelerated computing, NVIDIA provides hardware and software designed to accelerate development and deployment of generative AI applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Retailers have a lot of data, specifically a lot of data about products. And Retailers often have many products, sometimes in the realm of millions. As a customer (and as a Retail employee), it can be hard to navigate these vast product catalogs. And one may have questions about different products or questions comparing and contrasting different products.\n",
    "\n",
    "To purchase something in a pre-internet world, one would go into the Retail brick-and-mortar store where a sales associate intimiately familiar with that store's products could assist and advise them. These sales associates are experts and help suggest interesting products - maybe ones the customer hasn't thought of - and guide the customer on their journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a post-internet world, this personal touch and customer experience has been lost due to the scale of millions of products that sales associates can't reasonably be expected to memorize as well as the means of interacting with websites through a web browser or mobile device. LLMs - combined with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techiques - are very capable of ingesting information about a product (or several products) and responding to customers to answer questions, provide more details, and compare and contrast different products. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs and GenAI provide an incredible opportunity for Retailers to:\n",
    "* Empower and augment employees and help them better understand products,\n",
    "* Reduce costs of customer assistance, and\n",
    "* Provide a delightful customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NVIDIA Retail Product Advisor AI Workflow, we'll show how to developed an LLM-powered RAG application that can ingest product catalog data, reason about how to respond or which tools to use, as well as retrieve appropriate products and answer questions about them. Specifically, we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to use Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "* Using LLMs with Retail product data\n",
    "* How to create embeddings from product information\n",
    "* How to use those embeddings to retrieve products most similar to a given query\n",
    "* How to empower LLMs to make decisions like responding normally or using tools like Search/Shopping Cart APIs\n",
    "* How to put these pieces together into a single `ProductAdvisor` utility class\n",
    "* How to deploy this in a FastAPI backend and interact with that backend through a chatbox in a React application\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we'll import several modules and libraries we'll use througout this notebook."

    "\n",
    "There are several ways to interact with LLMs. Two of the more common ways are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Self-managed** - Downloaded LLM model, optimize with [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM), deploy with [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server) or [NeMo Inference Microservice](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-microservices-early-access), and interact with that deployed model using HTTP or gPRC. \n",
    "* **Hosted API** - Using HTTP calls, interact via API with a model hosted e.g. [NVIDIA NeMo LLM Service API](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-llm-service-early-access), [NVIDIA AI Playground](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/ai-foundation-models), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook and workflow, we will use the latter to get started in <2 minutes while also allowing flexibility for the former. Specifically, we will be using the [Mixtral 8x7B Instruct](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/mixtral-8x7b) model which can be found and accessed using NVIDIA AI Playground as well as OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can receive API keys for both models by navigating to the below links and following the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NVIDIA_API_KEY](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/mixtral-8x7b/api) - Look for the \"Generate Key\" box on the middle right-hand side\n",
    "* [OPENAI_API_KEY](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) - Create an account, log in, and select API keys on the left hand side\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your keys, set the following environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export NVIDIA_API_KEY=...\n",
    "export OPENAI_API_KEY=...\n",

    "* [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)\n",

    "In the code below, we create a `list` of messages - the first element representing a system prompt giving instructions to the LLM and the second element representing a user prompt with a variadic `{input}` variable. Next, we construct our prompt from these messages, instantiate our LLM using the [NVIDIA LangChain endpoints](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/nvidia), and construct our chain.\n",

    "We now have the basics of a LLM pipeline working. LLMs are incredibly powerful for generating text - however, they are prone to a) using information it has seen during training and b) hallunicating fake information and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can overcome the first hurdle by taking a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on data we expect it see during deployment. This is a very useful strategy for improving the quality of responses and constraining the output of LLMs to a particular domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this doesn't resolve the second hurdle - even if fine-tuned on a particular dataset, the LLM may still be prone hallunicating. And if we update our product catalog and add, modify, or remove products, we will need to fine-tune again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler but powerful technique for overcoming this hurdle is by providing information (called **context**) and instructions to the LLM on how to use that data. While there is a possibility the LLM will still hallunicate, this technique generally constrains the LLM to the information it has immediate access to. It also has the added benefit of allowing us to use the latest data - simply refresh the product catalog and the context provided to the LLM will change.\n",
