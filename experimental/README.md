# Experimental Examples

## What is an Experimental Example?

Experimental examples are sample code and deployments for RAG pipelines that are not tested by NVIDIA personnel.

## Inventory

* [NVIDIA Retail Product Advisor AI Workflow](./product-advisor)

  This example ingests product catalog data, determines how to respond or which tools to use, retrieves appropriate products, and answer questions about the products.

* [NVIDIA Multimodal RAG Assistant](./multimodal_assistant)

  This example is able to ingest PDFs, PowerPoint slides, Word and other documents with complex data formats including text, images, slides and tables. It allows users to ask questions through a text interface and optionally with an image query, and it can respond with text and reference images, slides and tables in its response, along with source links and downloads.

* [Run RAG-LLM in Azure Machine Learning](./AzureML)

  This example shows the configuration changes to using Docker containers and local GPUs that are required
  to run the RAG-LLM pipelines in Azure Machine Learning.
