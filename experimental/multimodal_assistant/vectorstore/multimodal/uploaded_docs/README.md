## What is Taipy Doc

Taipy is a Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our

install the minimum they need.

[Taipy Doc](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy-doc) has the responsibility to hold and build the full Taipy
documentation set. The `taipy-doc` repository uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate its entire
content.
