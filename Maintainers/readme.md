# NEW PROJECT OWNERS
This folder contains documents that cover how RAPIDS handles many processes. Not all of the documents within are going to be applicable to your library, and GitHub may not be where you want to host this information.

These should be viewed as references and to gain an understanding of what a fully documented library looks like. There is no problem with keeping these documents here - if you choose to use them:
- Update each document as required for your project
- Remove the `REF-` title of the file
- Update this readme to describe each file, and correct the links
  - (All of the links will be broken by removing the `REF-` tag

If you do not choose to use these, delete whatever is not used prior to going live.
