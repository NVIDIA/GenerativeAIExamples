        "question": "Retrieve time in cycles, all sensor measurements and RUL value for engine unit 24 from FD001 test and RUL tables. Predict RUL for it. Finally, generate a plot to compare actual RUL value with predicted RUL value across time.",

This visualization helps in assessing the accuracy of the RUL predictions.",
        "llm_judgment": "EVALUATION TYPE: PLOT - The generated plot matches the reference answer description. It shows two lines: one for the actual RUL (dashed teal line) and one for the predicted RUL (solid green line). The actual RUL line starts at a higher value and decreases over time, while the predicted RUL line remains constant throughout the time period. This visualization effectively compares the actual and predicted RUL values across time in cycles for engine unit 24.",
