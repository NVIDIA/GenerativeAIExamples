Question: {question}

Reference Answer: {reference_answer}

Generated Answer: {generated_answer}

Please evaluate the generated answer against the reference answer considering:
1. Factual accuracy and correctness
2. Completeness of the response
3. Technical accuracy for predictive maintenance context
4. Relevance to the question asked

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following format:
{{
    "score": <float between 0.0 and 1.0>,
    "reasoning": "<detailed explanation of your scoring>"
}}

The score should be:
- 1.0: Perfect match, completely accurate and complete
- 0.8-0.9: Very good, minor differences but essentially correct
- 0.6-0.7: Good, mostly correct with some inaccuracies or missing details
- 0.4-0.5: Fair, partially correct but with significant issues
- 0.2-0.3: Poor, mostly incorrect but some relevant information
- 0.0-0.1: Very poor, completely incorrect or irrelevant"""
