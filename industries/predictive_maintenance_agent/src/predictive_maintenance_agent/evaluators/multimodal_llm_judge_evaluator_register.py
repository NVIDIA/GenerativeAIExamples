Question: {question}

Reference Answer: {reference_answer}

Generated Response: {generated_answer}

Please evaluate the complete response considering:

TEXT EVALUATION:
1. Factual accuracy and correctness of technical information
2. Completeness of the response (does it answer all parts of the question?)
3. Technical accuracy for predictive maintenance context (RUL predictions, sensor data analysis, etc.)
4. Appropriate use of predictive maintenance terminology and concepts

VISUAL EVALUATION (if plots/charts are present):
1. Does the visualization show the correct data/variables as specified in the reference?
2. Are the axes labeled correctly and with appropriate ranges?
3. Does the plot type (line chart, bar chart, distribution, etc.) match what was requested?
4. Are the data values, trends, and patterns approximately correct?
5. Is the visualization clear and appropriate for predictive maintenance analysis?
6. Does the plot help answer the original question effectively?

COMBINED EVALUATION:
1. Do the text and visual elements complement each other appropriately?
2. Does the overall response provide a complete answer?
3. Is the combination more helpful than text or visuals alone would be?

For predictive maintenance context, pay special attention to:
- RUL (Remaining Useful Life) predictions and trends
- Sensor data patterns and operational settings
- Time-series data representation
- Unit/engine-specific data filtering
- Dataset context (FD001, FD002, etc.)

Provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following format:
{{
    "score": <float: 0.0, 0.5, or 1.0>,
    "reasoning": "<detailed explanation of your evaluation, covering both text and visual elements if present>"
}}

The score should be:
- 1.0: Completely correct response - text and any visuals match reference accurately, comprehensive and helpful
- 0.5: Partially correct response - some elements correct but significant issues in text or visuals
- 0.0: Completely wrong response - major errors in text or visuals that make the response unhelpful"""
