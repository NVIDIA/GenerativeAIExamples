Some of the key impacts include:\n\n1. Standardization: To ensure interoperability between different vendors, standardization is crucial. 3GPP, the standards body for 5G, has defined a set of specifications that vendors must adhere to, but there can still be variations in implementation. This can make it more challenging to introduce new services or slices that work seamlessly across different vendors' equipment.\n2. Integration: Integrating equipment and software from different vendors can be a complex process. It requires careful planning and testing to ensure that all components work together seamlessly and that new services or slices can be introduced without disrupting existing services.\n3. Management: Managing a multi-vendor 5G network can be more complex than a single-vendor network. Different vendors may have different management interfaces and tools, which can make it more difficult to monitor and manage the network as a whole. Additionally, fault detection and resolution may be more challenging in a multi-vendor environment.\n4.

The DDoS detection capability has two parts: the near real time detection, which takes place in a RIC xApp and a non-real time detection, which takes place at the SMO and relies on enrichment data originated in external system (e.g., 5G Core or OAM system) (see figure 4.15.3- 1).

Step 1 The IMS purges alarms because of a change in the Alarm Retention Period. Alarms that are older than the new Alarm Retention Period are purged. Old inactive alarms or acknowledged active alarms are purged by removing them from the Alarm List. The Alarm list Management Use Case Steps 3.1-4 are performed (REF) NOTE 3: Active alarms and unacknowledged active alarms are not purged irrespective of changes in the Alarm Retention Period changes.", "NOTE: If an alarm suppression is deactivated by the suppression deactivation policy, the policy-based alarm suppression deactivation needs to be notified to the SMO. How the IMS implements the Alarm Suppression is via the use of policies. How these policies are managed are described in the Alarm List Management Use Case [See 3.7.11]. Different kind of alarms could be raised with the same root cause by different entities. Some intelligence needs to identify a root cause of those alarms and correlate them.
