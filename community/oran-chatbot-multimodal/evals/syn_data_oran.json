Test Methodology Initial conditions An SCTP association is successfully established between the two SCTP endpoints of the E2 interface (SCTP initiation procedure has taken place before the execution of this test case). The DUT (E2 Node) and Test Simulator has successfully completed E2 Setup procedure. Procedure Step 1. Initiate appropriate action in DUT (E2 Node) to trigger E2 Removal procedure. Step 2. At the Test Simulator (Near-RT RIC) the received, transmitted E2 messages and SCTP Transport level messages are recorded. Step 3. The Test Simulator does the following validation:\nGiven the previous paragraph, create one very good question answer pair. Your output should be in a json format of individual question answer pairs.
