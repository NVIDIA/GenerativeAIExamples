These scenarios are used to ensure that the O-RAN components, such as O-RU, O-DU, and O-CU, comply with the O-RAN specifications and are interoperable with each other.", "question": "What is the purpose of the different UC-Plane test scenarios in the O-RAN Technical Specification?", "answer": "The O-RAN Technical Specification defines a set of test scenarios for the User Plane (UC-Plane) to verify the correct operation of the O-RAN architecture. The UC-Plane test scenarios are designed to cover various aspects of the O-RAN architecture, including the Radio Unit (RU), the Distributed Unit (DU), and the Centralized Unit (CU).\n\nThe purpose of the UC-Plane test scenarios is to ensure that the O-RAN architecture meets the requirements for various use cases, such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). The test scenarios cover a wide range of functionalities, including radio resource management, mobility management, and security.\n\nThe UC-Plane test scenarios are divided into two categories: conformance test scenarios and performance test scenarios. The conformance test scenarios are designed to verify the compliance of the O-RAN architecture with the O-RAN specifications, while the performance test scenarios are designed to evaluate the performance of the O-RAN architecture under various conditions.\n\nThe conformance test scenarios cover various aspects of the O-RAN architecture, including the interfaces between the RU, DU, and CU, the protocols used for communication between these components, and the procedures for radio resource management and mobility management. The performance test scenarios, on the other hand, evaluate the performance of the O-RAN architecture in terms of throughput, latency, and jitter, among other metrics.\n\nIn summary, the purpose of the UC-Plane test scenarios in the O-RAN Technical Specification is to verify the correct operation of the O-RAN architecture and to evaluate its performance under various conditions. The test scenarios cover a wide range of functionalities and use cases, and they are designed to ensure that the O-RAN architecture meets the requirements for various applications and services.", "contexts": []}, {"gt_context": "Scope General The present document defines tests that validate the conformance to the protocols defined in [2] for the Lower Layer Split Option 7.2x interface between the O-RU and the O-DU. A guiding principle for these conformance tests is to use only standard interfaces that are defined by the specification [2] or relevant 3GPP specifications. The construction of these tests avoids the requirement for a device to include any special interfaces used solely for the purpose of these tests. While these tests are not written to evaluate the performance of an O-DU or O-RU device, some tests require obtaining measurements and evaluating the success or failure of the device to process sample data correctly based on portion of the protocol being tested at the time. In general, unless otherwise stated, the tests cover LTE (Stand-Alone), NR Non-Stand-Alone (NSA) and NR Stand-Alone (SA). In the main body of this specification (in any \u201cchapter\u201d) the information contained therein is normative meaning binding on any compliant system, unless explicitly described as informative (a capability described as \u201coptional\u201d may or may not be included in a compliant system but if it is included it must comply with the optional capability description). Information contained in an \u201cAnnex\u201d to this specification is always informative. U-Plane and C-Plane Scope This version of the Conformance Test specification defines tests which validate the conformance of an O-RU and O-DU. The tests are designed to cover a large number of optional functionalities defined in [2]. Therefore, for any given O-RU implementation, a subset of these tests may not be applicable. It is the responsibility of the tester to understand the applicability of each test to the feature provided by a particular O-RU. S-Plane The Conformance Test specification defines tests for time synchronization of the O-RU and O-DU. The tests defined include both functional and performance tests. Functional tests validate the ability of the O-RU and O-DU to achieve the proper synchronization management state based on a variety of PTP, and optionally SyncE input conditions. Performance tests validate the conformance of the recovered clock for the O-DU or O-RU. Concerning the scope of the S-Plane, various synchronization options have been defined in the O-RAN CUS Specification [2] for distributing synchronization to the O-RU (LLS-C1, LLS-C2, LLS-C3 and LLS-C4). Depending on the specific O-RAN deployment being considered not all of them may be relevant. When testing the S-Plane, the tester shall identify which of the test cases are relevant depending on the specific deployment scenarios addressed. As a general guideline the following applies: \t\tDirect connection between O-DU and O-RU: LLS-C1 is generally the main sync option to be validated. LLS-C4 may be considered as alternative or as a complement to C1 \t\tSynchronization network between O-DU and O-RU LLS-C2 for cases where the synchronization is delivered to the O-RU via the O-DU and over the bridged network. In this topology the PRTC synchronizing the O-DU may be local or remote. LLS-C3 for cases when the synchronization is distributed to the O-RU without involving the O-DU. In this case one or more PRTC may be remote and may also be local. LLS-C4 may be considered as alternative or as a complement to LLS-C2/C3 For LLS-C1 and LLS-C2, a local PRTC is either embedded in or co-located with the O-DU. A remote PRTC is located anywhere in the network (backhaul or fronthaul). Test Requirement Status The following tables list each test in this conformance specification and status of the test as MANDATORY or CONDITIONAL MANDATORY.

It is responsible for processing and aggregating the radio signals received from multiple O-RUs (Open Radio Units) before forwarding them to the O-CU (Open Central Unit). The O-DU is typically located closer to the O-RUs, and it provides the necessary processing and coordination functions to support multiple radio access technologies (RATs) and multiple frequency bands.\n\nO-RU: The O-RU (Open Radio Unit) is a functional split of the radio unit (RU) in an ORAN architecture. It is responsible for transmitting and receiving radio signals to and from user equipment (UE) in a specific frequency band. The O-RU is typically located at the cell site, and it connects to the O-DU via a high-speed, low-latency interface. The O-RU can support multiple antenna configurations, including massive MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) and beamforming, to improve the capacity and coverage of the wireless network.\n\nIn summary, the O-DU and O-RU are key components of the ORAN architecture, which aims to provide a more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective approach to building and deploying wireless networks.", "contexts": []}, {"gt_context": "SCS\tOFDM Sub Carrier Spacing SSB\tSynchronization Signal Block, in 5G PBCH and synchronization signal are packaged as a single block subordinate\tThe term \u201csubordinate\u201d is used as a replacement for \u201cslave\u201d and is consistent with its use in CUS specification.

The S-Plane is responsible for managing the control and signaling functions of the RAN, including radio resource management, mobility management, and security functions.\n\nThe S-Plane is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing for the decoupling of the control functions from the user plane functions. This decoupling enables the use of different vendors for the control and user plane functions, which is a key aspect of the O-RAN architecture.\n\nThe S-Plane is defined by a set of interfaces and protocols that allow for communication between the various components of the RAN. These interfaces include the F1 interface, which connects the base station to the core network, and the E1 interface, which connects the base station to the radio unit.\n\nThe S-Plane also includes a set of functional components, such as the Radio Resource Management (RRM) function, which is responsible for managing the radio resources of the RAN, and the Mobility Management Entity (MME), which is responsible for managing the mobility of user equipment within the RAN.\n\nOverall, the S-Plane is a critical component of the O-RAN architecture, providing the control and signaling functions necessary for the operation of the RAN.", "contexts": []}]
