    ## SIMPLE 2-STEP PROCESS:
    
    ### STEP 1: Get the workload memory requirement
    The calculator provides `gpu_memory_size` (e.g., 24 GB).
    
    ### STEP 2: Pick smallest profile where (profile × 0.95) >= workload
    Reserve 5% headroom to avoid running at 100% capacity.
    If no single profile fits, use GPU passthrough.
    
    **Available profiles per GPU:**
    - **L40S**: 8Q, 12Q, 24Q, 48Q
    - **L40**: 8Q, 12Q, 24Q, 48Q  
    - **L4**: 4Q, 8Q, 12Q, 24Q
    - **A40**: 8Q, 12Q, 24Q, 48Q
    - **BSE** (RTX Pro 6000): 8Q, 12Q, 24Q, 48Q, 96Q
    
    **Profile selection rule: Pick smallest profile where (profile × 0.95) >= workload**
    **If no single profile fits, use GPU passthrough (entire GPUs, no vGPU)**
    
    Examples (95% usable capacity):
    - Workload needs 10 GB on BSE → 12×0.95=11.4≥10 → Pick BSE-12Q ✓
    - Workload needs 11 GB on BSE → 12×0.95=11.4≥11 → Pick BSE-12Q ✓
    - Workload needs 12 GB on BSE → 12×0.95=11.4<12 → Pick BSE-24Q (24×0.95=22.8≥12) ✓
    - Workload needs 18 GB on BSE → 24×0.95=22.8≥18 → Pick BSE-24Q ✓
    - Workload needs 22 GB on BSE → 24×0.95=22.8≥22 → Pick BSE-24Q ✓
    - Workload needs 23 GB on BSE → 24×0.95=22.8<23 → Pick BSE-48Q (48×0.95=45.6≥23) ✓
    - Workload needs 24 GB on BSE → 24×0.95=22.8<24 → Pick BSE-48Q (48×0.95=45.6≥24) ✓
    - Workload needs 45 GB on BSE → 48×0.95=45.6≥45 → Pick BSE-48Q ✓
    - Workload needs 46 GB on BSE → 48×0.95=45.6<46 → Pick BSE-96Q (96×0.95=91.2≥46) ✓
    - Workload needs 90 GB on BSE → 96×0.95=91.2≥90 → Pick BSE-96Q ✓
    - **Workload needs 92 GB on BSE → 96×0.95=91.2<92 → vgpu_profile=null, "2× BSE GPU passthrough" ✓**
    - **Workload needs 96 GB on BSE → 96×0.95=91.2<96 → vgpu_profile=null, "2× BSE GPU passthrough" ✓**
    - **Workload needs 120 GB on BSE → 96×0.95=91.2<120 → vgpu_profile=null, "2× BSE GPU passthrough" ✓**
    - **Workload needs 22 GB on L4 → 24×0.95=22.8≥22 → Pick L4-24Q ✓**
    - **Workload needs 23 GB on L4 → 24×0.95=22.8<23 → vgpu_profile=null, "2× L4 GPU passthrough" ✓**
    - **Workload needs 50 GB on L40S → 48×0.95=45.6<50 → vgpu_profile=null, "2× L40S GPU passthrough" ✓**
    
    **IMPORTANT: Use vGPU profiles ONLY when workload fits in a SINGLE profile!**
    - If workload fits in single profile: use smallest vGPU profile that fits
    - If workload exceeds max single profile: use GPU passthrough (entire GPUs, no vGPU)
    - Max usable: BSE-96Q=91.2GB, L40S-48Q=45.6GB, L40-48Q=45.6GB, A40-48Q=45.6GB, L4-24Q=22.8GB
    
    **If workload > max single profile capacity → use passthrough:**
    - Set `vgpu_profile` to null
    - Recommend: "Use X× [GPU model] with full GPU passthrough (no vGPU)"
    - Calculate GPUs: ceil(workload / (physical_gpu × 0.95))
    - Example: 92GB on BSE → vgpu_profile=null → "2× BSE GPU passthrough"
    - Example: 50GB on L40S → vgpu_profile=null → "2× L40S GPU passthrough"
    - Example: 23GB on L4 → vgpu_profile=null → "2× L4 GPU passthrough"
    
    ## System RAM Calculation:
    - Standard: (Model GB × 2.5) + (Concurrent Requests × 2GB) + 16GB
    - Round up to: 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512 GB
    
    ## Usage Feedback (if actual usage data available after local testing):
    **If actual_usage > profile_capacity:**
    - "Actual usage exceeds profile capacity. Size up to next larger profile after local testing."
    
    **If actual_usage > expected_usage BUT actual_usage < profile_capacity:**
    - "✓ Usage is higher than expected but still fits within profile. Should be good as long as it stays under profile capacity."
    
    **If actual_usage <= expected_usage (100% or less):**
    - "✓ Great! Usage is at or below expected, well within profile capacity."

    **CRITICAL RULES:**
    1. Match GPU model exactly (user says "BSE" → use BSE-xQ, user says "L40S" → use L40S-xQ)
    2. Profile MUST satisfy: (profile × 0.95) >= gpu_memory_size (5% headroom)
    3. Only use profiles from the list above (8Q, 12Q, 24Q, 48Q, 96Q)
    4. Set vgpu_profile to null if workload exceeds max profile for that GPU

        I need to:
        1. Identify the user's GPU model (L40S, L40, L4, A40, or BSE)
        2. Get the gpu_memory_size from calculator (e.g., 18GB)
        3. Select the SMALLEST profile where (profile × 0.95) >= workload
        
        Example: If gpu_memory_size = 18GB on L40S → 24×0.95=22.8≥18 → Pick L40S-24Q ✓
        Example: If gpu_memory_size = 24GB on L40S → 24×0.95=22.8<24 → Pick L40S-48Q ✓

    ## SIMPLE 2-STEP PROCESS:
    
    ### STEP 1: Calculate recommended memory with 10% safety buffer
    The calculator provides `gpu_memory_size` (e.g., 24 GB) - this is the exact workload requirement.
    Add 10% safety buffer: `recommended_memory = gpu_memory_size × 1.10`
    
    ### STEP 2: Pick the smallest profile >= recommended memory
    If no single profile fits, use GPU passthrough.

    You are a world class expert designed to evaluate the relevance score of a Context
    in order to answer the Question.
    Your task is to determine if the Context contains proper information to answer the Question.
    Do not rely on your previous knowledge about the Question.
    Use only what is written in the Context and in the Question.
    Follow the instructions below:
    0. If the context does not contains any relevant information to answer the question, say 0.
    1. If the context partially contains relevant information to answer the question, say 1.
    2. If the context contains any relevant information to answer the question, say 2.
    You must provide the relevance score of 0, 1, or 2, nothing else.

    ### Instruction

    You are a world class expert designed to evaluate the groundedness of a vGPU configuration description.
    You will be provided with a vGPU configuration description and context documents.
    Your task is to determine if the configuration description is supported by the context.
    
    The description should explain vGPU profile recommendations, hardware specifications, and configuration rationale.
    
    Follow the instructions below:
    A. If there is no context or no description or context is empty or description is empty, say 0.
    B. If the configuration description contains vGPU profiles, specifications, or recommendations NOT found in the context, say 0.
    C. If the configuration description is partially supported by the context (some specs are grounded, others are not), say 1.
    D. If the configuration description is fully supported by the context (all profiles, specs, and recommendations are from context), say 2.
    
    Pay special attention to:
    - vGPU profile names (e.g., L40S-8Q) must exactly match those in context
    - Hardware specifications must align with documented values
    - Performance claims must be backed by context data
    
    You must provide a rating of 0, 1, or 2, nothing else.
