    "##### **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic question-answer pairs from structured financial documents, specifically **10-K filings**. By leveraging LLMs, we can create high-quality Q&A datasets that help evaluate **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems in financial applications.\n",

    "Manually curated Q&A datasets are **expensive and time-consuming** to create. Synthetic data generation using LLMs offers a scalable alternative, enabling:\n",
    "- **Efficient dataset creation** for RAG model evaluation.\n",
    "- **Diverse and comprehensive** question sets from real-world documents.\n",
    "- **Customization** based on specific retrieval and generative tasks.\n",

Additionally, FTSE Russell, another provider of widely followed stock indices, has stated that it plans to require new constituents of its indices to have at least five percent of their voting rights in the hands of public stockholders. Many investment funds are precluded from investing in companies that are not included in such indices, and these funds would be unable to purchase Altair Engineering Inc.'s Class A common stock. Altair Engineering Inc. cannot assure you that other stock indices will not take a similar approach to S&P Dow Jones or FTSE Russell in the future. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from indices could make Altair Engineering Inc.'s Class A common stock less attractive to investors. As a result, the market price of Altair Engineering Inc.'s Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\\nIf financial or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about Altair Engineering Inc.'s business or if they issue inaccurate or unfavorable commentary or downgrade Altair Engineering Inc.'s Class A common stock, Altair Engineering Inc.'s stock price and trading volume could decline.\"}]\n",
