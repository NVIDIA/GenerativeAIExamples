    "### **Fine-Tuning a Smaller LLM for Accurate Triplet Predictions**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will **fine-tune a smaller Large Language Model (LLM) for more accurate triplet predictions** using [**NVIDIA NeMo**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/ai-data-science/products/nemo/) and [**NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIM)**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/ai/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Introduction to NVIDIA NeMo and NIM**  \n",
    "[NVIDIA NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/ai-data-science/products/nemo/) is a **scalable, cloud-native generative AI framework** designed for researchers and developers working with Large Language Models, Multimodal AI, and Speech AI (e.g., Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech). It allows users to efficiently create, customize, and deploy generative AI models by leveraging existing code and pre-trained model checkpoints.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIM)](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/ai/) is a **suite of microservices** that enables fast and seamless deployment of AI models. NIM can be used on-premises or in **DGX Cloud**, allowing users to transition models to self-managed hosting with minimal code changes. These microservices are designed to scale dynamically based on load and run efficiently on GPUs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Fine-Tune a Smaller LLM?**  \n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained for a wide range of tasks. However, for this specific use case, we only need the model to predict **triplets** from given text. Instead of deploying a large LLM, we use **LLM distillation** to train a smaller, more efficient model that retains the accuracy of a larger model while consuming fewer computational resources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Distillation** is a process where a **large LLM (teacher model)** is used to train a **smaller LLM (student model)**. The smaller model learns by replicating the teacherâ€™s output, achieving similar accuracy with reduced computational overhead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While teacher models provide high accuracy, they are resource-intensive. Deploying them for a single task is often inefficient. Instead, a **fine-tuned student model** offers significantly better throughput while meeting business-related performance KPIs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Tutorial Overview**  \n",
    "In this tutorial, we will fine-tune the **LLaMa-3 8B** model using NVIDIA NeMo and deploy it with NVIDIA NIM. We will cover the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Preparation**: How to collect and preprocess data for LLM distillation  \n",
    "- **Fine-Tuning LLaMa-3 8B**: Setting up and fine-tuning the model using NVIDIA NeMo (the model is pre-downloaded, and the necessary Python scripts are provided)  \n",
    "- **Deploying the Fine-Tuned Model**: Using NVIDIA NIM for efficient model deployment  \n",
    "- **Querying the Deployed Model**: Interacting with the model to make predictions  \n",
    "- **Enhancing Accuracy**: Additional techniques to improve model performance  \n",
