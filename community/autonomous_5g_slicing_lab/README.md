Agentic LLMs for 5G Section
Once you have the 5G Lab GitHub repository cloned, you can proceed to the Agentic LLMs section. This part of the lab demonstrates how to deploy an agentic workflow to monitor network performance and dynamically adjust bandwidth allocation.

Part A – Setup of 5G Lab environment
Located at: ./autonomous5g_slicing_lab/llm-slicing-5g-lab/DLI_Lab_Setup.ipynb
Provides instructions to set up a 5G Network Software Stack in your environemnt.

Part B – 5G Network Agent Workflow
Located at: ./autonomous5g_slicing_lab/agentic-llm/agentic_pipeline_DLI.ipynb
Explains the agentic pipeline in LangGraph for managing 5G network slicing and bandwidth allocation.
