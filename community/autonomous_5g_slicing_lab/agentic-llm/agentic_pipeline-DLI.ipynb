    "        - It stores intermediate results, tool outputs, and agent decisions.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### About Streamlit:\n",
    "[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a lightweight Python framework for building interactive web applications with minimal effort. It enables users to create and deploy data-driven dashboards and tools using simple Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features of the UI:\n",
    "- Real-time Log Monitoring – View live logs generated by the agent.\n",
    "- Packet Loss Visualization – Monitor real-time packet loss of UE1 and UE2 using dynamic charts.\n",
    "- Agent Control – Start and stop the agent directly through the UI."
