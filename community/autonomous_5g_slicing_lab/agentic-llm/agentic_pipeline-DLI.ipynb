    "\n",
    "### Overview  \n",
    "This notebook outlines how the 5G network configuration works—how it detects SDU buffer full errors and reconfigures the network. We will use concepts demonstrated in [intro_agents.ipynb](intro_agents.ipynb) to build this agent using LangGraph and LangChain.\n",

    "![Architecture diagram](./images/architecture_diagram.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents**:\n",
    "1. **Monitoring Agent**:  \n",
    "    - Continuously reads gNodeB logs from `../llm-slicing-5g-lab/logs/gNodeB.log`.  \n",
    "    - Analyzes each chunk for SDU buffer full errors.  \n",
    "    - Routes to the Configuration Agent if an error is detected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configuration Agent**:  \n",
    "    - Called when an error is detected in the gNodeB logs.  \n",
    "    - Has two tools bound to it: `get_packet_loss` and `reconfigure_network`.  \n",
    "    - First, retrieves the latest packet loss logs from the database using the `get_packet_loss` tool.  \n",
    "    - Analyzes the logs and determines which UE needs more bandwidth. Based on this, it assigns higher bandwidth to the selected UE.  \n",
    "    - Calls the `reconfigure_network` tool to use xAPP and reconfigure the network.  \n",
    "    - Returns control to the Monitoring Agent to continue monitoring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools**:\n",
    "1. **`get_packet_loss`**: Queries the database and retrieves a DataFrame containing per-UE packet loss statistics.  \n",
    "2. **`reconfigure_network`**: Calls the xAPP with optimized slicing parameters to adjust network configurations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Error Logs  \n",

    "We have defined two agents—the **Monitoring Agent** and the **Configuration Agent**—as combinations of a model and the tool(s) they have access to. This is achieved using LangGraph's `create_react_agent()` function, which creates an agent that employs ReAct prompting.\n",

    "**States in Graph**  \n",
    "        - A state represents the evolving context of execution, maintaining data across multiple steps.  \n",
    "        - It stores intermediate results, tool outputs, and agent decisions.  \n",

    "**Nodes and Edges in LangGraph**  \n",
