# Contributing Guidelines

We're posting these examples on GitHub to support the NVIDIA LLM community and facilitate feedback. 
We invite contributions! 

Use the following guidelines to contribute to this project.


## Pull Requests
Developer workflow for code contributions is as follows:

1. Developers must first [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the upstream this repository.
2. Git clone the forked repository and push changes to the personal fork.
3. Once the code changes are staged on the fork and ready for review, a Pull Request (PR) can be requested to merge the changes from a branch of the fork into a selected branch of upstream.
4. Since there is no CI/CD process in place yet, the PR will be accepted and the corresponding issue closed only after adequate testing has been completed, manually, by the developer and/or repository owners reviewing the code.


## Signing Your Work
We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.
To sign off on a commit, use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

`$ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."`
This will append the following to your commit message:

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
