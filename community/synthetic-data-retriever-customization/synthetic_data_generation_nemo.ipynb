    "## Introduction\n",
    "Text retrievers and embedding models play a crucial role in modern information retrieval systems by converting both queries and documents into dense numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture their semantic meaning. This allows the system to find relevant documents by measuring the similarity between a query's embedding and document embeddings in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of these models directly impacts their usefulness. When a retriever has been trained primarily on one type of content (like general web text or news articles) but is asked to retrieve documents from a specialized domain (such as medical literature), its performance can degrade significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why many organizations fine-tune domain-specific retrievers for their particular use cases, ensuring more accurate and relevant document retrieval. As with all fine-tuning, high-quality domain-specific data is required and can be generated with LLMs such as [NVIDIA's Nemotron-4-304B-Instruct](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nemotron-4-synthetic-data-generation-llm-training/) that are specially trained and licensed for synthetic data generation.

    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This two-part tutorial demonstrates how to improve retrieval performance by fine-tuning embedding models using synthetic training data. The process is split across two notebooks:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. `synthetic_data_generation_nemo.ipynb` **(this notebook)**:\n",
    "    - Use an LLM from build.nvidia.com (or deploy your own using NIM!) to create training examples containing generated queries and positive chunks. By default the notebook will use nfcorpus, but you can easily swap in your own data.\n",
    "    - Implement hard negative mining to find challenging negative examples\n",
    "    - Save results to a `.jsonl` file \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `retriever_customization.ipynb`\n",
    "    - Use the generated training data in the `.jsonl` file to fine-tune a retriever model using Nemo Framework\n",
    "    - Evaluate the results of your fine-tuned embedding model against the original using BeIR Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This tutorial is only meant as a demo, and hence only a small subset of the corpus is used for training data generation - in order for the notebook run to complete in a reasonable time."

    "#### NeMo Framework Docker Container ####\n",
    "This notebook runs in a Docker environment built from the NeMo FW repo. Refer https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main for instructions on how to build and run the docker containers. Ensure that the docker container you run this notebook in is built from the main branch of the NeMo repository. The current notebooks were tested on Nemo Framework 24.07 on a single-GPU machine (L40s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Run docker when inside the `synthetic-data-retriever-customization` directory using this command:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### NVIDIA AI Endpoints\n",
    "You'll need access to an **LLM** for generating queries and a **Text Embedding Model** for mining hard negatives. By default, this notebook uses the [Nemotron-4-340b-Instruct](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-instruct) and [NV-EmbedQA-E5-V5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5) API endpoints from [www.build.nvidia.com](https://www.build.nvidia.com), for the LLM and text embedding models respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "**An API Key is required.** Get your API Key by following the link above to the model and clicking on \"Build with this NIM\". All new users will get a number of tokens upon registering. Set the environment variable NVIDIA_API_KEY with your API key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can self-host either model using **[NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservice](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/getting-started.html)** and pass in the local url when creating your LLM client later on. Follow the instructions in the link. Note that system GPU requirements will depend on the model you choose to deploy.  \n"

    "Hard negative mining refers to the creation of negative examples that are 'hard'. Essentially, what this means is that rather than performing random sampling - which would lead to easy negatives - we mine for harder negative examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has an advantage that the negatives would not be obvious to the model during training, and hence would actually be more helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, hard negative mining has a higher probability of generating false negatives. To avoid this, we set a safety `margin`. This margin is a hyperparameter and you may change it depending on if more false negatives are being generated. For instance, a larger corpus has a higher probability of generating false negatives than a smaller one, as the probability of finding another positive increases. In such cases a lower `margin` value may be more helpful.\n",

    "To do hard negative mining, we'll need to create embeddings for all of our text chunks using the [NV-EmbedQA-E5-V5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5) model from www.build.nvidia.com. You can reuse the same NVIDIA_API_KEY as before. This is also the embedding model we will fine-tune in the next part of this tutorial. \n",

    "Since the NV-Embedqa-E5-V5 model is quite small, you can also easily host it as self-deployed NIM Docker container following the instructions [here](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5?snippet_tab=Docker). If you already have the model weights downloaded in preparation for fine-tuning, you can also restore the model using NeMo Framework. To do that, simply copy the encode_text() function from Notebook 2 and use it here. "

DESIGN: Prospective, interventional case series. METHODS: Seventy puncta from 44 eyes of 28 dry eye patients underwent punctal occlusion with thermal cautery. All patients had a history of recurrent punctal plug extrusion. A high heat-energy-releasing thermal cautery device (Optemp II V; Alcon Japan) was used for punctal occlusion surgery. Symptom scores, best-corrected visual acuity, fluorescein staining score, rose bengal staining score, tear film break-up time, and Schirmer test values were compared before and 3 months after the surgery. Rate of punctal recanalization also was examined. RESULTS: Three months after surgical cauterization, symptom score decreased from 3.9 ± 0.23 to 0.56 ± 0.84 (P < .0001). Logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.11 ± 0.30 to 0.013 ± 0.22 (P = .003). Fluorescein staining score, rose bengal staining score, tear film break-up time, and the Schirmer test value also improved significantly after the surgery. Only 1 of 70 puncta recanalized after thermal cauterization (1.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Punctal occlusion with the high heat-energy-releasing cautery device not only was associated with a low recanalization rate, but also with improvements in ocular surface wetness and better visual acuity.

Secondary investigations to identify the presence of bacterial biofilms on the inner surface of the bottles and to assess different sterilization methods were also undertaken. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational. METHODS: Eleven patients with recalcitrant CRS who were already using nasal irrigation as part of their treatment regimen were examined every 2 weeks for a period of 6 weeks. At each visit, a culture sample was taken from their irrigation bottle and middle meatus, and they were given a new irrigation bottle. Irrigation bottles from six patients were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to detect biofilm formation. Finally, new bottles were inoculated with different strains of Staphylococcus aureus and then cleaned with different methods. The bottles were cultured immediately after cleaning and 48 hours later. RESULTS: Overall, 42 of 43 (97%) bottles collected demonstrated bacterial growth. Concurrent sinonasal and bottle infection with S. aureus was seen in 51% of patients during the study. Bacterial biofilms were demonstrated on the inner surface of four of the six irrigation bottles tested. Treatment with Milton's solution (1% NaOCl plus 19% NaCl) and microwaving were found to be effective methods for sterilizing the bottles both initially after the cleaning and 48 hours later. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who irrigate their nose and sinuses commonly contaminate their irrigation bottle, most often with S. aureus, which can be in the biofilm form. Simple cleaning methods could reduce contamination of the bottles.\", 'In vitro and in vivo efficacy of sulfo-carrabiose, a sugar-based cosmetic ingredient with anti-cellulite properties.\\nMost of adult women exhibit cellulite on the hips, buttock and thighs. Although extracellular matrix and lymphatic system disorders can increase its appearance, cellulite basically results from an excessive fat storage in the adipose tissue which exerts considerable pressure on the surrounding skin tissue and creates a dimpled irregular appearance. Caffeine, the most widely used anti-cellulite ingredient, favours fat break-down by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase enzyme and encouraging a high intracellular level of cAMP. A series of studies has shown that spermine and spermidine, two ubiquitous polyamines, encouraged fat storage and slowed fat break-down in the adipose tissue. Besides, it was shown that heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans had a strong affinity for polyamines. To design a new cosmetic ingredient with anti-cellulite properties, we used molecular modelling to screen several ingredients with a structure similar to that of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. This way, we identified sulfo-carrabiose as a potent molecule for trapping spermine and spermidine. These virtual results were first confirmed in tubo where sulfo-carrabiose was shown to dose-dependently inactivate spermine and spermidine. In vitro, adipocytes cultured with sulfo-carrabiose exhibited a significant reduction of lipogenesis and a significant increase of lipolysis. When sulfo-carrabiose was incorporated in a cosmetic formula, significant improvements were observed in thigh circumference, with better results than those obtained with caffeine after 28 days of use. Furthermore, a combination of caffeine and sulfo-carrabiose led to results significantly better than those obtained with caffeine alone. As measured by fringe projection, thigh volume was also significantly reduced after sulfo-carrabiose treatment. Finally, the appearance of cellulite assessed by clinical evaluation was also significantly reduced within 28 days. © 2010 BASF Beauty Care Solutions.

Both conditions share the same quality of pain, eliciting and relieving activities and a varying degree of functional deficits. There is no single mechanism for muscle soreness; instead, it is a culmination of 6 different mechanisms. The developing pathway of DOMS begins with microtrauma to muscles and then surrounding connective tissues. Microtrauma is then followed by an inflammatory process and subsequent shifts of fluid and electrolytes. Throughout the progression of these events, muscle spasms may be present, exacerbating the overall condition. There are a multitude of modalities to manage the associated symptoms of immediate soreness and DOMS. Outcomes of each modality seem to be as diverse as the modalities themselves. The judicious use of NSAIDs and continued exercise are suggested to be the most reliable methods and recommended. This review article and each study cited, however, represent just one part of the clinician's decisionmaking process. Careful affirmation of temporary deficits from muscle soreness is not to be taken lightly, nor is the advisement and medical management of muscle soreness prescribed by the clinician.\", 'Dysmenorrhea.\\nDysmenorrhea is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absence in adolescent girls and a common problem in women of reproductive age. Risk factors for dysmenorrhea include nulliparity, heavy menstrual flow, smoking, and depression. Empiric therapy can be initiated based on a typical history of painful menses and a negative physical examination. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial therapy of choice in patients with presumptive primary dysmenorrhea. Oral contraceptives and depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate also may be considered. If pain relief is insufficient, prolonged-cycle oral contraceptives or intravaginal use of oral contraceptive pills can be considered. In women who do not desire hormonal contraception, there is some evidence of benefit with the use of topical heat; the Japanese herbal remedy toki-shakuyaku-san; thiamine, vitamin E, and fish oil supplements; a low-fat vegetarian diet; and acupressure. If dysmenorrhea remains uncontrolled with any of these approaches, pelvic ultrasonography should be performed and referral for laparoscopy should be considered to rule out secondary causes of dysmenorrhea. In patients with severe refractory primary dysmenorrhea, additional safe alternatives for women who want to conceive include transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, acupuncture, nifedipine, and terbutaline. Otherwise, the use of danazol or leuprolide may be considered and, rarely, hysterectomy. The effectiveness of surgical interruption of the pelvic nerve pathways has not been established.', \"The economic burden of dry eye disease in the United States: a decision tree analysis.\\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to estimate both the direct and indirect annual cost of managing dry eye disease (DED) in the United States from a societal and a payer's perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the annual cost for managing a cohort of patients with dry eye with differing severity of symptoms and treatment. The direct costs included ocular lubricants, cyclosporine, punctal plugs, physician visits, and nutritional supplements. The indirect costs were measured as the productivity loss because of absenteeism and presenteeism. The model was populated with data that were obtained from surveys that were completed by dry eye sufferers who were recruited from online databases. Sensitivity analyses were employed to evaluate the impact of changes in parameters on the estimation of costs. All costs were converted to 2008 US dollars. RESULTS: Survey data were collected from 2171 respondents with DED. Our analysis indicated that the average annual cost of managing a patient with dry eye at $783 (variation, $757-$809) from the payers' perspective. When adjusted to the prevalence of DED nationwide, the overall burden of DED for the US healthcare system would be $3.84 billion. From a societal perspective, the average cost of managing DED was estimated to be $11,302 per patient and $55.4 billion to the US society overall. CONCLUSIONS: DED poses a substantial economic burden on the payer and on the society. These findings may provide valuable information for health plans or employers regarding budget estimation.\"]}\n"
