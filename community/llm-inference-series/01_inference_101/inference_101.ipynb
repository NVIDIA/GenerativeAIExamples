    "\n",
    "- Receiving a **prompt** (a string of text)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sampling parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating text, the model can either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always pick the highest-probability token** (greedy decoding ‚Äî fast and deterministic)\n",
    "- **Sample from the probability distribution** over possible next tokens ‚Äî which adds variety and creativity\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the following parameters to control that behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `temperature = 0.7`: Controls randomness. Lower values ‚Üí more confident, deterministic outputs. Higher values ‚Üí more diverse, sometimes erratic responses.\n",
    "- `top_p = 0.9`: Enables **nucleus sampling** ‚Äî the model samples only from the top tokens that together make up 90% of the probability mass. Balances diversity and coherence.\n",
    "- `top_k = 50`: Further restricts sampling to the top 50 tokens at each step (can be used alone or with `top_p`).\n",
    "- `max_tokens = 512`: The maximum number of tokens to generate per prompt.\n",
    "- `stop = [\"</s>\"]`: Tells the model to stop when it sees the end-of-sequence token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these settings ensure the output is diverse but not chaotic ‚Äî a good balance for most use cases.\n",
