    ## SIMPLE 2-STEP PROCESS:
    
    ### STEP 1: Get the workload memory requirement
    The calculator provides `gpu_memory_size` (e.g., 24 GB).
    
    ### STEP 2: Pick smallest profile where (profile × 0.95) >= workload
    Reserve 5% headroom to avoid running at 100% capacity.
    
    **Available profiles per GPU:**
    - **L40S**: 8Q, 12Q, 24Q, 48Q
    - **L40**: 8Q, 12Q, 24Q, 48Q  
    - **L4**: 4Q, 8Q, 12Q, 24Q
    - **A40**: 8Q, 12Q, 24Q, 48Q
    - **BSE** (RTX Pro 6000): 8Q, 12Q, 24Q, 48Q, 96Q
    
    **Profile selection rule: Pick smallest profile where (profile × 0.95) >= workload**
    
    Examples (95% usable capacity):
    - Workload needs 10 GB on BSE → 12×0.95=11.4≥10 → Pick BSE-12Q ✓
    - Workload needs 11 GB on BSE → 12×0.95=11.4≥11 → Pick BSE-12Q ✓
    - Workload needs 12 GB on BSE → 12×0.95=11.4<12 → Pick BSE-24Q (24×0.95=22.8≥12) ✓
    - Workload needs 18 GB on BSE → 24×0.95=22.8≥18 → Pick BSE-24Q ✓
    - Workload needs 22 GB on BSE → 24×0.95=22.8≥22 → Pick BSE-24Q ✓
    - Workload needs 23 GB on BSE → 24×0.95=22.8<23 → Pick BSE-48Q (48×0.95=45.6≥23) ✓
    - Workload needs 24 GB on BSE → 24×0.95=22.8<24 → Pick BSE-48Q (48×0.95=45.6≥24) ✓
    - Workload needs 45 GB on BSE → 48×0.95=45.6≥45 → Pick BSE-48Q ✓
    - Workload needs 46 GB on BSE → 48×0.95=45.6<46 → Pick BSE-96Q (96×0.95=91.2≥46) ✓
    - Workload needs 90 GB on BSE → 96×0.95=91.2≥90 → Pick BSE-96Q ✓
    - Workload needs 92 GB on BSE → 96×0.95=91.2<92 → vgpu_profile=null, recommend "1× BSE GPU passthrough" ✓
    - Workload needs 120 GB on BSE → Exceeds single GPU → vgpu_profile=null, recommend "2× BSE GPU passthrough" ✓
    - **Workload needs 22 GB on L4 → 24×0.95=22.8≥22 → Pick L4-24Q ✓**
    - **Workload needs 23 GB on L4 → 24×0.95=22.8<23 → vgpu_profile=null, recommend "1× L4 GPU passthrough" ✓**
    - **Workload needs 24 GB on L4 → 24×0.95=22.8<24 → vgpu_profile=null, recommend "1× L4 GPU passthrough" ✓**
    - **Workload needs 25 GB on L4 → Exceeds single L4 → vgpu_profile=null, recommend "2× L4 GPU passthrough" ✓**
    
    **If workload exceeds max vGPU profile capacity with 5% headroom:**
    - Max usable capacities: BSE-96Q (91.2GB), L40S-48Q (45.6GB), L40-48Q (45.6GB), A40-48Q (45.6GB), L4-24Q (22.8GB)
    - Set `vgpu_profile` to null
    - In description field, recommend: "Use X× [GPU model] with full GPU passthrough (no vGPU)"
    - **IMPORTANT: Even with passthrough, reserve 5% for driver/OS overhead. Use 95% of physical memory.**
    - Calculate GPUs needed: ceil(workload / (physical_gpu × 0.95))
    - Physical GPU capacities: BSE=96GB, L40S=48GB, L40=48GB, A40=48GB, L4=24GB
    - Example: 92GB on BSE → ceil(92/91.2)=2 GPUs → "Use 2× BSE GPU passthrough" (96GB × 2 = 192GB total)
    - Example: 120GB on BSE → ceil(120/91.2)=2 GPUs → "Use 2× BSE GPU passthrough" (96GB × 2 = 192GB total)
    - Example: 185GB on BSE → ceil(185/91.2)=3 GPUs → "Use 3× BSE GPU passthrough" (96GB × 3 = 288GB total)
    - Example: 24GB on L4 → ceil(24/22.8)=2 GPUs → "Use 2× L4 GPU passthrough" (24GB × 2 = 48GB total)
    - Example: 50GB on L40S → ceil(50/45.6)=2 GPUs → "Use 2× L40S GPU passthrough" (48GB × 2 = 96GB total)
    - Example: 144GB on L40S → ceil(144/45.6)=4 GPUs → "Use 4× L40S GPU passthrough" (48GB × 4 = 192GB total)
    
    ## System RAM Calculation:
    - Standard: (Model GB × 2.5) + (Concurrent Requests × 2GB) + 16GB
    - Round up to: 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 384, 512 GB
    
    ## Usage Feedback (if actual usage data available after local testing):
    **If actual_usage > profile_capacity:**
    - "Actual usage exceeds profile capacity. Size up to next larger profile after local testing."
    
    **If actual_usage > expected_usage BUT actual_usage < profile_capacity:**
    - "✓ Usage is higher than expected but still fits within profile. Should be good as long as it stays under profile capacity."
    
    **If actual_usage <= expected_usage (100% or less):**
    - "✓ Great! Usage is at or below expected, well within profile capacity."

        I need to:
        1. Identify the user's GPU model (L40S, L40, L4, A40, or BSE)
        2. Get the gpu_memory_size from calculator (e.g., 18GB)
        3. Select the SMALLEST profile where (profile × 0.95) >= workload
        
        Example: If gpu_memory_size = 18GB on L40S → 24×0.95=22.8≥18 → Pick L40S-24Q ✓

    ## SIMPLE 2-STEP PROCESS:
    
    ### STEP 1: Calculate recommended memory with 10% safety buffer
    The calculator provides `gpu_memory_size` (e.g., 24 GB) - this is the exact workload requirement.
    Add 10% safety buffer: `recommended_memory = gpu_memory_size × 1.10`

    ### Instruction

    You are a world class expert designed to evaluate the groundedness of a vGPU configuration description.
    You will be provided with a vGPU configuration description and context documents.
    Your task is to determine if the configuration description is supported by the context.
    
    The description should explain vGPU profile recommendations, hardware specifications, and configuration rationale.
    
    Follow the instructions below:
    A. If there is no context or no description or context is empty or description is empty, say 0.
    B. If the configuration description contains vGPU profiles, specifications, or recommendations NOT found in the context, say 0.
    C. If the configuration description is partially supported by the context (some specs are grounded, others are not), say 1.
    D. If the configuration description is fully supported by the context (all profiles, specs, and recommendations are from context), say 2.
    
    Pay special attention to:
    - vGPU profile names (e.g., L40S-8Q) must exactly match those in context
    - Hardware specifications must align with documented values
