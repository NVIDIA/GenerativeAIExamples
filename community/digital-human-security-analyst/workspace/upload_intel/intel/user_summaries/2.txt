**Event Overview**
Username: daniel@domain.com, Time Range: 2022-08-29 23:20:54.550308 to 2022-08-30T17:27:30Z, Apps: Box, Google Cloud / G Suite Connector by Microsoft, Spike Email - Mail & Team Chat, WeVideo, Devices: Mobile Apps and Desktop clients, deviceDetailbrowser: Chrome 100.0.4896, deviceDetailoperatingSystem: Windows 10, Mac OS

**Triage Overview**
The event appears to be a collection of authentication logs for a single user, daniel@domain.com, over a long period of time. The logs are from various applications and devices, but a majority of them are from Box and Google Cloud / G Suite Connector by Microsoft. The time range of the event is from August 31, 2022, to May 30, 2024, which is a significant amount of time. Based on my cyber knowledge, this suggests that the user may have been compromised or is using malicious software to access these applications. The frequency and variety of devices and applications used are also unusual, which could be indicative of malicious activity.

**Most Anomalous Fields**
The most anomalous fields in this event are the z-scores for the logcount, appincrement, and appDisplayName fields. The z-scores for these fields are significantly higher than the mean absolute z-score, indicating that these values are far from the average values for this user. Specifically:

* logcount: z-scores range from 102.22567749023438 to 248.405029296875, indicating that the log count for this user is significantly higher than usual.
* appincrement: z-scores range from 101.62947082519531 to 633.4866333007812, indicating that the number of distinct apps used by this user is significantly higher than usual.
* appDisplayName: z-scores range from 6.132417678833008 to 12.531970977783203, indicating that the display name of the app used by this user is significantly more diverse than usual.

**Cyber Triage**
* The user's log count and app increment suggest that they may be using multiple accounts or have been compromised.
* The diversity of app display names and devices used may indicate that the user is using malicious software or has been compromised.
* The unusual time range of the event and the frequency of the logs may indicate that the user's account has been compromised or is being used for malicious activity.
* The fact that the user is using multiple devices and applications may indicate that they are trying to evade detection or hide their activity.
* The high z-scores for logcount, appincrement, and appDisplayName fields suggest that the user's activity is significantly different from the norm and may warrant further investigation.

**Threat Intelligence Enrichment and Recommendation**
The threat intelligence snippets provided suggest that this behavior may be related to APT activity. The use of multiple devices, applications, and IP addresses is consistent with the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by APT groups. The high z-scores for logcount, appincrement, and appDisplayName fields suggest that the user's activity is significantly different from the norm and may be indicative of malicious activity.

Recommendation: Further investigation is required to confirm the presence of APT activity. Potential IOCs to look out for and investigate in correlation with the event include:

* IP addresses: 5.189.145.248, AS63949
* Domains: offlineearthquake[.]com, valuevault[.]com, longwatch[.]com
* Malware families: VALUEVAULT, LONGWATCH, PICKPOCKET
* Techniques: Obfuscated files or information, Indicator removal on host, Tor

These IOCs should be correlated with the event to determine if they are related to the activity observed in this incident.
