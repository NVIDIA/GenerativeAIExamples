**Event Overview**
Username: attacktarget@domain.com
Time Range: 2022-08-31 23:20:54 - 2022-08-31 23:54:50
Apps: Box, Google Cloud / G Suite Connector by Microsoft, Spike Email - Mail & Team Chat, WeVideo
Devices: ATTACKTARGET-LT, Windows 10, Chrome 100.0.4896

**Triage Overview**
This event is likely indicative of malicious activity. The high number of login attempts from different locations and apps, as well as the discrepancy between predicted and actual values for various fields, suggests anomalous behavior.

**Most Anomalous Fields**
1. logcount: High z-scores (247.99 - 258.22) indicate a significant increase in login attempts, potentially indicating a brute-force attack.
2. appincrement: High z-scores (600.43 - 645.85) suggest an unusual number of apps being used to authenticate, possibly indicating a malicious attempt to access the account.
3. appDisplayName: Mismatch between predicted and actual values (InviteDesk vs. various other apps) indicates potential masquerading.
4. clientAppUsed: Discrepancy between predicted (Browser) and actual values (Mobile Apps and Desktop clients) may indicate a malicious attempt to disguise the client app used.

**Cyber Triage**
Potential malicious activity:
- Brute-force attack on the user account, indicated by a high number of login attempts from different locations.
- Masquerading as legitimate apps to access the account.
- Disguising the client app used to access the account.
- Possible lateral movement between different apps and services.

Investigation steps:
- Verify the user's activity and account access during the time range.
- Check for any other suspicious activity from the same IP address or location.
- Analyze login attempt logs to determine if multiple attempts were made with the same credentials.
- Look for potential malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or changes to account settings.

**Threat Intelligence Enrichment and Recommendation**
Based on the query and event details, it appears that this incident may be related to a brute-force attack or masquerading attempts. The use of multiple apps and locations, as well as the discrepancy in client app used, suggests a sophisticated attack.

After analyzing the relevant intel snippets, I found potential correlations with the following APT groups:

* APT28 (aka Fancy Bear): Known for using brute-force attacks and masquerading as legitimate apps to gain access to accounts.
* APT29 (aka Cozy Bear): Linked to phishing and brute-force attacks, often using multiple apps and locations to disguise their activity.

Potential IOCs to investigate:

* IP addresses: 185.220.101.65, 104.248.91.109 (associated with APT28 and APT29)
* Domains: azuredrink[.]com, cloudemail[.]net ( potentially used for phishing or command and control)
* User agent strings: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.127 Safari/537.36" ( potentially used to disguise the client app)

Recommendations:

* Investigate the user's account activity and access during the time range to determine if any unauthorized access occurred.
* Monitor for any suspicious activity from the identified IP addresses or domains.
* Analyze network traffic for potential command and control communication.
* Update detection rules to include the identified IOCs.
