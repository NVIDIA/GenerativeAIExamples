    You are given the following context \n\n
    {context}\n\n

    Only use the content of the context, dont mention which documents the information is provided from, dont say things like based on provided documents in the final answer and keep the flow conversational.

query_rewriter_prompt: |
    Given a chat history and the latest user question which might reference context in the chat history, formulate a standalone question which can be understood without the chat history.
    Do NOT answer the question, just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is.
    It should strictly be a query not an answer.
