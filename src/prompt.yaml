    ### Instructions

    You are a world class expert designed to evaluate the relevance score of a Context
    in order to answer the Question.
    Your task is to determine if the Context contains proper information to answer the Question.
    Do not rely on your previous knowledge about the Question.
    Use only what is written in the Context and in the Question.

    Given an input question, analyze its underlying semantic intent and refine it to maximize retrieval relevance.
    Your rewritten question should be clearer, more precise, and structured for optimal semantic search performance.
    Output only the rewritten questionâ€”no explanations, comments, or additional text.

    ### Context:
    <{context}>

    ### Assertion:
    <{response}>

    Analyzing Context and Response, the Groundedness score is
