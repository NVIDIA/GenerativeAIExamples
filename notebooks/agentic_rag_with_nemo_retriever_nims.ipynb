    "# Agentic RAG pipeline with Nemo Retriever and LLM NIMs \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be an effective strategy for ensuring large language model (LLM) responses are up-to-date and not hallucinated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Various retrieval strategies have been proposed that can improve the recall of documents for generation. There is no one-size-fits-all all. The strategy (for example: chunk size, number of documents returned, semantic search vs graph retrieval, etc.) depends on your data.  Although the retrieval strategies might differ, an agentic framework designed on top of your retrieval system that does reasoning, decision-making, and reflection on your retrieved data is becoming more common in modern RAG systems.  An agent can be described as a system that can use an LLM to reason through a problem, create a plan to solve the problem, and execute the plan with the help of a set of tools.  For example, LLMs are notoriously bad at solving math problems, giving an LLM a calculator “tool” that it can use to perform mathematical tasks while it reasons through a larger problem of calculating YoY increase of a company’s revenue can be described as an agentic workflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "As generative AI systems start transitioning towards entities capable of performing \"agentic\" tasks, we need robust models that have been trained on the ability to break down tasks, act as central planners, and have multi-step reasoning capabilities with model and system-level safety checks. With the Llama 3.1 family, Meta is launching a suite of LLMs spanning  8B, 70B, and 405B parameters with these tool-calling capabilities for agentic workloads. NVIDIA has partnered with Meta to make sure the latest Llama models can be deployed optimally through NVIDIA NIMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, with the general availability of the NVIDIA NeMo Retriever collection of NIM microservices, enterprises have access to scalable software to customize their data-dependent RAG pipelines. The NeMo Retriever NIMs can be easily plugged into existing RAG pipelines and interfaces with open source LLM frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex, so you can easily integrate retriever models into generative AI applications.\n"

These microservices can be deployed within the enterprise locally, and are packaged together with <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/triton-inference-server\">NVIDIA Triton Inference Server</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt\">NVIDIA TensorRT</a> for optimized inference of text for embedding and reranking.  Additional enterprise benefits include:\n",

    "The new Llama 3.1 set of models can be seen as the first big push of open-source models towards serious agentic capabilities. These models can now become part of a larger automation system, with LLMs doing the planning and picking the right tools to solve a larger problem. Since NVIDIA Llama 3.1 NIMs have the necessary support for OpenAI style tool calling, libraries like LangChain can now be used with NIMs to bind LLMs to Pydantic classes and fill in objects/dictionaries. This combination makes it easier for developers to get structured outputs from NIM LLMs without having to resort to regex parsing. You can access Llama 3.1 405B at ai.nvidia.com.

    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving passages or documents within a RAG pipeline without further validation and self-reflection can usually result in unhelpful responses and factual inaccuracies. Additionally, since the models aren't explicitly trained to follow facts from passages, post-generation verification is necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent frameworks, like LangGraph, enable developers to group LLM application-level logic into nodes and edges, for finer levels of control over agentic decision-making. LangGraph with NVIDIA LangChain OSS connectors can be used for embedding, reranking, and implementing the necessary agentic RAG techniques with LLMs (as discussed previously). \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, an application developer must include the finer-level decision-making on top of their RAG pipeline. Figure below shows one of the many renditions on a router node depending on the use case. Here, the router takes a decision to rewrite the query with help on an LLM, perchance of better recall from the retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./imgs/agentic_rag.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query decomposer**: Breaks down the question into multiple smaller logical questions, and is helpful when a question needs to be answered using chunks from multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Router**: Decides if chunks need to be retrieved from the local retriever to answer the given question based on the relevancy of documents stored locally. Alternatively, ‌the agent can be programmed to do a web search or simply answer with an ‘I don't know.’\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retriever**: This is the internal implementation of the RAG pipeline. For example, a hybrid retriever of a semantic and keyword search retriever.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grader**: Checks if the retrieved passages/chunks are relevant to the question at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hallucination checker**: Checks if the LLM generation from each chunk is relevant to the chunk.  Post-generation verification is necessary since the models are not explicitly trained to follow facts from passages.\n",
