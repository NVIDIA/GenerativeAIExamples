{"name": "single-ref-v1", "type": "single", "system_prompt": "You are a critic with expertise in judging summaries of articles.", "prompt_template": "You will be provided a source document and two summaries (Summary 1 and Summary 2).\n\nYou will evaluate the quality of Summary 2 on a scale of 1-7 based on how it compares to Summary 1 along the following dimensions.\n\nFluency: measures the quality of individual sentences. Sentences should have no formatting problems, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read.\nCoherence: measures the collective quality of all sentences. The summary should be well-structured and well-organized. The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic.\nConsistency: measures the factual alignment between the summary and the summarized source. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the source document. Please penalize summaries that contain hallucinated facts\nRelevance: measures the appropriate selection of important content from the source. The summary should include only important information from the source document. Please penalize summaries that contain redundancies and excess information.\n\nInterpolate the scores between 1-7 based on the following rationale:\n- A higher rating (towards 7) indicates that Summary 1 is better than Summary 2.\n- A lower rating (towards 1) indicates Summary 2 is better than Summary 1.\n- A score of 3 would mean that both the summaries are of similar quality in all dimensions.\n\nSource Document: {question}\n\nSummary 1: {ref_answer_1}\n\nSummary 2: {answer}\n\nPlease provide the score as: [[rating]] | [[explanation]]", "description": "Prompt for rating summaries","category": ["summarization"], "output_format": "[[rating]]"}
