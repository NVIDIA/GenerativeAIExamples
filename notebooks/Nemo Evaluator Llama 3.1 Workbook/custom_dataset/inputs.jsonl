My guess is that there are rulings in place that preclude certain witnesses from being called, certain evidence from being shown, and certain topics from being broached - but how, and why? And are those constraints known to the jury? For instance, there was a last minute witness that somehow offered herself up to testify, a very crucial character witness, that i would have thought the plaintiff would spare no expense in finding. There was a photo expert that was somehow prevented from talking about colors, there is a lot of confusion about the existence or non-existence of a wall mounted phone, but both parties have refrained from showing images of the wall that the phone should have hung on - although the existence of such photos is a near certainty, etc. So my questions: How are such no-show-no-tell boundaries established, does the jury get to know them, and is this also in the public record somehow? \nTITLE: ", "ideal_response": "What are the constraints on a civil suit (witnesses, evidence, topics) - and are they public", "category": "summarization"}

This year I am traveling rather large distances for work. My colleague asked me how I can bear the costs of travel. I told her it is ok, because the government allows me to deduct a large part of my travel costs from my taxes. My colleague warned me that she has heard that the government will revoke these rules, making it no longer possible to deduct as much of my travel costs from my taxes. Her argument was that since my taxes for 2019 will be done in april of 2020, the government could, at any point before that date, change the rules so that I may no longer be able to deduct my travel expenses.

His defence was that he was killing Talat Pasha in retaliation for his crimes in orchestrating the Ottoman Armenian Genocide. Tehlirian was tried for murder, but was eventually acquitted by the twelve-man jury. His trial was a rather sensationalized event at the time, taking place shortly after the establishment of the Weimar Republic, with Tehlirian being represented by three German defense attorneys, including Dr. Theodor Niemeyer, professor of law at Kiel University. Priest and Armenian Genocide survivor Grigoris Balakian, German activist Johannes Lepsius, and German commander of the Ottoman armed forces during the war General Liman von Sanders were among several of the prominent individuals called as witnesses to the trial. The trial examined not only Tehlirian\u2019s actions but also Tehlirian's conviction that Tal\u00e2t was the main author of the Armenian deportation and mass killings. The defense attorneys made no attempt to deny the fact that Tehlirian had killed a man, and instead focused on the influence of the Armenian Genocide on Tehlirian's mental state. Tehlirian claimed during the trial that he had been present in Erzincan in 1915 and had been deported along with his family and personally witnessed their murder. When asked by the judge if he felt any sort of guilt, Tehlirian remarked, \"I do not consider myself guilty because my conscience is clear\u2026I have killed a man. But I am not a murderer. However, murder in retaliation for crimes the victim committed is often not considered a legal defence to the act of murder. For example, this 2013 Baltimore case resulted in the sentencing of the killer to 30 years in jail. Similarly, the Lillehammer affair involves Israeli Mossad agents sent to assassinate a (mistakenly identified) mastermind of the Munich attacks on Israelis. The agents were arrested and convicted by Norwegian authorities. A final example was the case of Vitaly Kaloyev, who stabbed to death the air traffic controller responsible for the \u00dcberlingen mid-air collision in which his family was killed. He was also convicted for murder in that case and sentenced to prison.

I'm studying a chapter on a book about Bonds where I see: A bond is a special form of contract, whereby one party, the surety, guarantees the performance by another party, the principal, of certain obligations. The party to whom the obligations are owed is called the obligee. Reading this link I find: Insurance: When a claim is paid the insurance company usually doesn\u2019t expect to be repaid by the insured. Surety Bond: A surety bond is a form of credit, so the principal is responsible to pay any claims. Typically, the surety requires the principal and its major shareholders to indemnify the surety against any loss. In fact, the indemnity given by the principal is one of the things that distinguishes a bond from an insurance contract My doubt is: If as a contractor(principal) you will be required to repay to the surety for any losses that the surety had to pay to the owner(obligee). What are the advantages of a bond over liability insurance where the insurance company pays and the contractor doesn't have to repay anything else that the usual monthly premiums? Why creating the figure of the surety if the contractor will end up having to pay the surety to compensate for what the surety paid to the obligee anyway? Why not using liability insurance for this?

But I am confused with certain measures taken thus far by the government. There is currently a temporary shutdown of vast sectors of the economy now and workers affected are not receiving any income. To me, logic would dictate that here should also be a temporary cessation of payments for rental properties (for small businesses as well as individuals) and, to be fair, a temporary cessation of payments for loans for owners of those properties. In turn, banks would be given temporary cessation payments for interest to its customers since the banks would not receive any payments on loans including payments on mortgages from homeowners. That would essentially close the loop on money flow which again would be temporary and the impact to the greater economy would be limited. If undue burden is placed on any one of these points in the cycle, and right now, workers and small businesses are taking that brunt, then there could be long-standing damage to the economy from bankruptcies, foreclosures, etc. The Fed is already addressing the banking side of things by keeping rates close to 0.

There is one way to include a website inside another: <iframe> (w3schools description) However, some websites decide that they don't want to get iframed. For example Google doesn't allow other websites to frame their content. This has of course certain reasons. There is a very simple option, the X-Frame-Option that can tell a browser that it must not render a page withing a frame if it is not from the same origin as the page itself. So far so good. Just for the sake of completeness I want to say that it's still possible to display just the content of another website. The most trivial one would be to hit CTRL + S on my keyboard, save the website and host it on another server. A more sophisticated of course would be to write a program that does that for me. One could simply download the HTML page and embed the result into another. I can imagine that e.g. copyright could be an issue. But what if my site states that it does not own the content etc. and that it did not modify anything and so on. Is there a way that this could be legal? Example What is with this example? https://proxy-nl.hide.me allows you to enter any URL and e.g. specify that it should remove JavaScript code.

The title should be legally relevant, capture key aspects of the issue, and entice readers to learn more. \nQUESTION: This question comes out of reading this New York Times article (quoted below), about a bill that would allow officers to use a \"textalyzer\" to digitally search phones for evidence that the phones had been handled recently: The technology could determine whether a driver had used the phone to text, email or do anything else that is forbidden under New York\u2019s hands-free driving laws, which prohibit drivers from holding phones to their ear. Failure to hand over a phone could lead to the suspension of a driver\u2019s license, similar to the consequences for refusing a Breathalyzer. The intention is behavior change: \u201cWe need something on the books where people\u2019s behavior can change,\u201d said [F\u00e9lix W. Ortiz, a Democratic assemblyman who was a sponsor of the bipartisan Textalyzer bill], who pushed for the state\u2019s 2001 ban on hand-held devices by drivers. If the Textalyzer bill becomes law, he said, \u201cpeople are going to be more afraid to put their hands on the cellphone.\u201d The US Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that when somebody is arrested, their phone can't be searched without a warrant. But the bill\u2019s authors say they have based the Textalyzer concept on the same \u201cimplied consent\u201d legal theory that allows the police to use the Breathalyzer: When drivers obtain a license, they are consenting in advance to a Breathalyzer, or else they will risk the suspension of their license. (Emphasis added.) The analogy to the Breathalyzer is based on comparability of dangers, too: Deborah Hersman, the president of the nonprofit National Safety Council and a former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, ... said the Textalyzer-Breathalyzer comparison was apt because looking at and using a phone can be as dangerous as driving drunk. \u201cWhy are we making a distinction between a substance you consume and one that consumes you?\u201d How far does this \"implied consent\" legal theory go? Can it be extended to mean that drivers' license applicants give \"implied consent\" to have their cars, homes, or body cavities searched in detail, or give \"implied consent\" to physical control by police (to enforce any failures to comply with an instruction), etc., if police request that power and find a suitably sympathetic audience in the General Assembly? It's an old argument that increasing police search powers increases safety, because it allows the police to search out and stamp out whatever behavior creates the danger to others. Where's the line, if any, which limits the extent of how far that can go? What do people really consent to when applying for a driver's license? Can \"implied consent\" be retroactive, such that if I have a New York driver's license today, that means I've given \"implied consent\" to whatever permissions the General Assembly grants police a couple years after I've gotten that license? If not, does a license renewal establish that \"consent?\" There is some precedent in that having gotten a NY license a few years ago does indicate consent to be bound by traffic laws including updates and changes that occur during the period of license validity. Is \"implied consent\" to searches one of the topics covered by that? This is tagged for New York, but as the article notes: If it were to pass in New York,... it could well spread in the same way that the hands-free rules did after New York adopted them. So feel free to answer for other jurisdictions, if they are a better fit for your expertise, and note that in your answer. \nTITLE: ", "ideal_response": "What are the limits of \"implied consent\" when obtaining a driver's license?", "category": "summarization"}

They were not only ineffective, but I experienced withdrawal symptoms taking those. What legal recourse do I have? Obviously, the attorney's fee will cost more than the Rx. Here are the details... Cutting the tablets in half, it was obvious that the previous tablets --that were effective-- looked different from the last Rx that was not. The tablets that were effective had a layer of dark gray on one side; the \"dud\" batch did not, but instead had an all-white interior. As soon as I took the replacement non-time-release alternative Rx prescribed by my physician, I experienced relief from the withdrawal symptoms as well as my medical condition. The M.D. told me that I needed to contact the pharmacy. Well, both the manager of the Sam's Club pharmacy in Springfield, MO and the lady I spoke with at the drug manufacturer have flatly stated (over the phone) that they will neither accept a return (or even samples for testing) nor refund the price we paid for these dud, ineffective tablets. The lady at the manufacturer told me that they would file a manufacturing defect report to the FDA. That was all. The pharmacy manager claimed that the tablets for the previous, effective Rx was from the same batch as the last, \"dud\" Rx refill. What to do?

I was given a fine (which was more than fair given my mistake), paid it without contesting, and then renewed my plates (with a late fee). The payments for my plate sticker went through and I was able to confirm that my plates were listed in the Secretary of State database as \"In Good Standing\". A week later I was still waiting for my sticker to come in the mail but parked my car on a city street. A Chicago officer issued another expired plates violation for my vehicle while I was away and didn't have an opportunity to explain that my plates were now in good standing for atleast the past week and I was merely waiting for the sticker in the mail. I immediately contested this ticket online, providing evidence of my receipt from the Secretary of State's office that I had renewed well before this ticket was issued (and worded it as formally and politely as I could have). I thought when my situation was reviewed it would be rather open and shut, and the fine would be dropped; however today I received a letter in the mail that a local judge had reviewed my case and determined the violation was still in affect. It then stated I would need to pay additional money in order to open a civil lawsuit to sue the city of Chicago if I wanted to appeal further; otherwise, I would need to pay my fine. It is my understanding they are probably within their right to press forward on charging me (I believe state law is that even if your plates are in good standing you can be fined for not displaying your sticker within 30 days of the original expiration date); however, I felt my situation would have been more understandable and that I had done my best to renew my plates prior to when this new violation was issued. In short, I have a 60 dollar fine (not for having expired plates but for not receiving my sticker quickly enough to display). Please let me know if a circuit court in Chicago would be even be willing to see things from my perspective or if I should just hand over more money. Lastly, If I were to file a civil lawsuit how much would I expect to pay to even try appealing this? Would I effectively be losing more money than if I just paid this fine? I tried to get this answered by calling the circuit court's financial department yesterday but they just transferred me to different branches for over an hour. \nTITLE: ", "ideal_response": "Do I have grounds to file a civil lawsuit against the City of Chicago for my Expired Plates Violation?

This process of hiding users data is considered anonymization and as such should not be applicable. On the other hand, this approach will ensure that information about users who had option A activated last year will be kept without storing the users personal information. However, by matching multiple sources, someone COULD potentially still find out what this number was.

What I would really like to understand is whether the right to be forgotten section in GDPR means: \"The person is forgotten about\" or \"all the person's data is erased\". Can anyone please share a reputable source that either explains how can we still comply to GDPR given when the data is erased in the application layer, it is actually not erased in reality and may still be recoverable, or a source that explains that the data is permitted to still be recoverable. I give three examples below for cases where even though the data may be erased in the application layer, it may still be recoverable in reality. Some databases have journaling, redo and undo spaces. Hence, if you delete data from the database, it might still be recoverable. Is this a problem for GDPR compliance? For disaster recovery purposes, data is often backed up, and sometimes on sequential append only media devices such as tape drives. If you need to erase data to comply to GDPR, do you still need to take care to delete the data from the backup? How is this done? In some cases you'd need to re-write the entire storage unit again to a new storage unit to accommodate for this.

We are in a rural area and don't have many options in providers, so I'm pretty much stuck with who I have. I'm set up on auto-draft and have never missed a payment, and we have never had an interruption in service. We are happy with our internet speed, and do not need anything faster. About a year and a half ago, they tried to tell me the plan I'm on is no longer available and they wanted to charge me slightly more and move me to one of their new plans. I declined their \"faster and more reliable internet\" (because it already is fast and reliable) and they told me they would keep my service and my bill the same ($42.74/mo). They said that as long as I don't change my plan, I'm grandfathered-in at the price and service I'm getting, and that there was nothing they could do about it. Yesterday, I received a letter in the mail (from NewWave) stating, \"The internet service I subscribe to is being discontinued, and my service is being moved to a comparable service or plan.\" Same thing they tried to tell me before. That comparable plan takes me from 1000 GB Data Plan ($42.74/mo) to a lower 300GB plan ($55.00/mo) and if I go over the 300GB, they will charge me an EXTRA $10/mo for every 100GB I go over. They note that my actual monthly data usage for the Oct-Dec months has been 701GB. In what world is that a comparable plan? I called the number on the letter, and they said that NewWave Communications is being bought out by Cable ONE, and that this new company is going to charge me TWICE the amount for a \"new\" plan that I've always had because this new company says my plan doesn't exist. Look, my internet is just fine the way it is. Nobody is coming out to my house and re-wiring anything, and I'm not asking for anything more other than to leave me and my bill alone. Shouldn't this \"new\" company honor the price that I've had for years? I mean, AT&T and Verizon don't offer unlimited plans to people anymore, but the people who got on those plans before they changed what they offer weren't forced to get another plan, right? They are grandfathered-in. When Cable ONE acquires NewWave, don't they have to honor the previous agreements of the people that had them before they bought the company? I understand that this new company structures their plans differently. Fine. When they get new customers, that's what they'll have to pay, but I am NOT a new customer. I am the same customer, paying the same price (with apparently slower service than the rest of the world even though we can't tell and don't care to to know the difference), and I'm getting the same service I have always gotten. Just because Company A sold to Company B, what gives them the right to all of a sudden charge me double? I didn't ask for any of this, and as an honorable customer in good standing, I do not appreciate being treated like this.

Vandevelde This \u201cbut for\u201d test has proved inadequate where two defendants jointly cause an injury that would have occurred even if only one of them had acted. For example, if two men negligently discharge firearms, both of which fire fatal shots into the victim, in a lay sense of the term both men \u201ccaused\u201d the injury. Yet by applying the \u201cbut for\u201d test, neither man can be shown to have caused it. If the first man had not fired his weapon, the victim would still have been killed by the second shot. Thus, one cannot say that but for the first man\u2019s negligence, the injury would not have occurred. The same reasoning exonerates the second man as well. [1.] The \u201cbut for\u201d test, in other words, would absolve both gunmen of liability for the shooting. Accordingly, many courts have adopted a rule that provides an alternative definition of actual causation. Under this rule, a defendant\u2019s breach of duty is considered the actual cause of an injury if it was a substantial factor in bringing about the injury, even though the breach may not have been the \u201cbut for\u201d cause.

For example, if somebody has leased property like a vehicle and defaults on their lease the most expeditious way for the true owner to recover the property seems to be repossession, which is essentially physical recovery by \"reasonable\" force. But when it comes to a living space the old saying, \"Possession is nine-tenths of the law,\" seems almost literally applicable: To my knowledge, in the United States at least, there are state and local laws that make it extremely cumbersome for a property owner to evict a tenant in default (and thereby recover the use of their rightful property). Is this accurate? Or are there conditions or methods whereby a property owner can legally use private force (i.e., not the force of agents of the state) and occupation to repossess living spaces being held by \"squatters?\" Amendment: If someone trespasses on my property I can not only arrest them myself, but I can also immediately summon police and ask for their arrest and criminal prosecution.

The use of a permanently attached antenna or of an antenna that uses a unique coupling to the intentional radiator shall be considered sufficient to comply with the provisions of this section. The manufacturer may design the unit so that a broken antenna can be replaced by the user, but the use of a standard antenna jack or electrical connector is prohibited. [...] 47 CFR \u00a7 15.212(a)(2)(iv): Manufacturers must ensure that only transmitter control elements and radio front end components that have been approved together are capable of operating together. The transmitter module must not operate unless it has verified that the installed transmitter control elements and radio front end have been authorized together. Manufacturers may use means including, but not limited to, coding in hardware and electronic signatures in software to meet these requirements, and must describe the methods in their application for equipment authorization. As a result, manufacturers are forced to actively design wireless radio devices to prevent unauthorized end-user modifications: The RP-TNC connector used for Wi-Fi antennas was originally meant to be a nonstandard connector to prevent consumers from replacing antennas with those not approved by the manufacturer. The connector ultimately gained widespread use; however, the FCC has not taken action against device manufacturers. Major laptop manufacturers, including Dell, HP, and Lenovo, restrict the specific Wi-Fi cards which may be installed into a particular system through the use of \"whitelists\" in system firmware that specify which card models are allowed. If a Wi-Fi card that isn't on the whitelist is installed, the system will not boot. Why hold the manufacturer responsible for preventing end-users from making modifications?

Just to be clear, that isn't strictly correct, right? A quick wikipedia search shows that in Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc. As a distributor, CompuServe could only be held liable for defamation if it knew, or had reason to know, of the defamatory nature of the content. As CompuServe had made no effort to review the large volume of content on its forums, it could not be held liable for the defamatory content. In one source online, I even saw Section 230 described as Congress enacted \u00a7 230 to remove the disincentives to self-regulation So which is it? Does the removal Section 230 mean a site will be held liable for the content created by others? Or, does it mean that a site will only be held liable if they engage in optional moderation or acts of \"publishing\" (such as filtering and removal of offensive material).

This level of control over the Journalism Forum is insufficient to rise to the level of an agency relationship.

But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. Is a separate law needed to prohibit people to whom Section 3 applies from taking office, or to remove such people from office? What proceedings would be needed to establish that a person had \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\"? Can a Congressional resolution or a Federal statute declare that specific people have so engaged? Is a criminal conviction required? Can a private person take steps to enforce this section? \nTITLE: ", "ideal_response": "How can section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the US constitution be enforced?", "category": "summarization"}

However, in cases where a consumer records a conversation between him and a company offering them service (e.g. Comcast Cable), and before the human conversation begins there is a recorded notification that the call will be recorded for quality assurance, doesn't that count as consent? If anything, it proves intention for the business to record the call! Thus, in a two-consent state such as California, if I were to record my call to Comcast, and that notice was heard over the phone, both parties (myself and the employee speaking with me) have consented by taking the call. Would this be legal then? \nTITLE: ", "ideal_response": "Recording a phone conversation with customer support/sales", "category": "summarization"}

This makes me wonder how 'criminality' is defined if the laws of my home country differ from the country the computer is in. I'm wondering at what point the location of a server/computer decide the laws that apply to it and at what point it's the location of the user that matters. To give some examples, not so much expecting answers to all of the below so much as explaining my confusion of distinction in case it informs an answer. For example, lets say I choose to view material that is not legal for me to view in my home state (copyright material I haven't payed for, some type of outlawed pornography, some sort of state secret I'm not suppose to see etc), but which is legal to view in the country in which some server I connect to is located. I'm pretty sure I've committed a crime, even if the computer providing the data is illegal, but is this only because the data was copied to my computer? If I use some VNC technology that shows me the screen of another computer located outside of the US to view this data without any of it stored or cached on my computer, am I still committing a crime (I think so?) On the other hand I see servers located outside of the US doing things that would be illegal in the US, online gambling, 'spamming' people, selling things without paying US taxes etc. Can I connect to a server for any reason and still be legal? If amazon want's to have a server in some country X and pay that countries taxes instead of US taxes can someone from the US still connect to that server to do anything at all with it without suddenly being guilty of violating a law because that server isn't abiding by US law? If it's the location of the user that matters then does that mean I can use a computer outside the US to do something that is illegal in that country? If I'm in the US and using a cloud computer hosted in say the UK and for some reason I end up doing something with that computer that is 100% legal in the US but isn't legal in UK (maybe some data is allowed to view here that isn't there?) have I broken the law in UK? If I happen to travel to UK at some later date could a zealous prosecute arrest me because of the location of my computer? (I realize this last question is probably comes down to \"it depends on the country\", but generally speaking for countries that practice common law is there a consensus that most countries agree on?) \nTITLE: ", "ideal_response": "Does legality of an computerized action depend on user location or computer location?", "category": "summarization"}
